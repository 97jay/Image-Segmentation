# Image-Segmentation

The goal of this task is to use K-Means Clustering to segment any input image. Specifically,
we set K = 2 and the clustering is only based on the Euclidean distance of pixel values.The goal is to 
design a program and output the best clustering result. The desired output is such
that the sum of distances between pixel values and their corresponding centers is minimum. Then we should
output the segmentation map replacing the pixel values with the corresponding centers. We also print the 
output of the running time.
